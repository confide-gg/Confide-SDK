# Confide SDK

Post-quantum secure messaging SDK powering the Confide Server & Clients.

This SDK provides cryptographic primitives and protocols for building secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging applications with post-quantum security guarantees.

## Features

- Post-quantum key encapsulation using ML-KEM-1024 hybrid with P-384
- Digital signatures using ML-DSA-87
- Double Ratchet protocol for forward secrecy
- Group messaging with sender keys
- End-to-end encrypted voice/video calls
- Account recovery mechanisms
- Safety number verification
